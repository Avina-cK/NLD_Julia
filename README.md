# NLD_Julia
This project contains code for a few nonlinear dynamical systems analysed using Julia-1.1.1 for an Undergraduate year long project. The thesis itself shall be uploaded after July 24th.

## Chua Circuit
The Chua circuit is a well studied system to observe chaotic orbits. The code includes a LTSpice simulation and a .jl code that plots the bifurcation diagram for different values of R. The bifurcation diargam of the chua circuit allows one to search for periodic orbits (in windows in the chaos). 
Note: The code itself can be modified to produce the bifurcation diagram for other ode systems and other parameters.
